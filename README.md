# NodeJS Base Structure Creator

## Overview

This package provides a convenient solution for setting up the fundamental structure of a Node.js project. It streamlines the process of creating directories, essential files, and boilerplate code to help kickstart your Node.js application development.

## Features

- **Structured Project Setup:** Automatically generates a well-organized directory structure tailored for Node.js applications.

- **File Initialization:** Creates key files such as `app.js`, `db.js`, and `index.js` with placeholder content to guide you in building a robust application.

- **Ready-to-Use Template:** A starting point for your Node.js project, offering a foundation that includes basic server setup, database configuration, and the main entry point for your application.

## How to Use

### Local Testing

1. Open the terminal in the root directory of your Node.js project.

2. Use the following command to create a compressed archive (`.tgz`) of your project structure:

    ```bash
    npm pack
    ```

3. Navigate to your local project directory:

    ```bash
    cd /path/to/your/local/project
    ```

4. Install the locally created package into your project:

    ```bash
    npm install /path/to/your/package-1.0.0.tgz
    ```


Now, you can easily integrate this package into your Node.js projects using npm.

## Example Folder Structure
- src
  - controllers
  - models
  - routes
- config
- app.js
- db.js
- index.js

This structure is designed to enhance code organization and maintainability in your Node.js applications.
